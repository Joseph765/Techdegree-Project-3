This project was created to get myself used to working with HTML forms and targeting them CSS and JavaScript, as well as getting practice
with jQuery that will be used to validate different inputs on the form. 

In order to complete this project I will need to have a good knowledge and understanding of JavaScript conditional statements for responding
to user actions based on the information they will be submitting. The goal of this project is to see how much jQuery I can use in the place 
of vanilla JavaScript so that I can write the code more concisely while getting used to writing with jQuery. This project also uses DOM maniulation
methods such as targeting elements, and listening for user events.
